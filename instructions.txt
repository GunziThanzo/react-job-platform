I have a React project using Vite, with Tailwind CSS configured. 1. Install React Router for routing. 
2. Develop a job search website using React. The site should simulate a job search environment by 
displaying dummy job listings(programming, design, marketing, bank teller, etc) that users can browse, search, and filter based on various criteria.
